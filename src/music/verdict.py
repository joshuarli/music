"""Lossy-transcode detection via spectral brickwall analysis.

Lossy encoders (MP3, AAC, Vorbis, Opus) apply a steep low-pass filter at a
bitrate-dependent cutoff (e.g. 16 kHz for 128 kbps MP3, 20.5 kHz for 320 kbps).
A genuine lossless file has a gradual natural roll-off; a lossy-to-lossless
transcode preserves the encoder's abrupt brickwall.

We detect the brickwall with a multi-point slope profile:

1. Measure RMS at 5 frequency bands (15k, 17k, 19k, 20.5k, 21.5k Hz) plus an
   unfiltered overall RMS — all in a single ffmpeg call via asplit=6.
2. Compute the drop between each adjacent pair of bands.
3. If any adjacent drop exceeds BRICKWALL_DROP_DB (25 dB), that is a codec
   brickwall — not a natural roll-off — and the file is flagged as
   "Suspected Transcode (Lossy)".

The analysis frequencies are constant regardless of sample rate because the
encoder cutoff does not move with the container — a 96 kHz FLAC transcoded
from MP3 still has its brickwall at ~20 kHz, not at 40 kHz.

Design decisions:

- **Multi-point over two-point** — A single-drop test at 18→21.5 kHz misses
  128 kbps MP3 brickwalls at 16 kHz.  Measuring at 15/17/19/20.5/21.5 kHz
  catches brickwalls at any common encoder cutoff.
- **RMS peak-hold over sample peak** — `astats` reports the loudest short-window
  RMS across the scan. This preserves sparse full-bandwidth passages without
  letting a single click dominate the measurement.
- **Maximum adjacent drop** — A brickwall concentrates its energy gap into a
  single adjacent band pair; a natural roll-off distributes the drop evenly.
- **Fixed analysis frequencies** — Codified in BRICKWALL_DROP_DB / LOW_ENERGY_DB
  / NO_HF_DB so the thresholds are easy to tune after field experience.
- **Middle 60 seconds** — Seeks to the file midpoint and scans 60 s.
  The middle is most representative — it avoids intro silence and fade-outs
  while keeping scans fast.
- **Hi-res check is separate** — 88.2/96/192 kHz files with no energy above
  25 kHz are flagged as upsampled, not as lossy transcodes.

Guards:

- Overall RMS < LOW_ENERGY_DB (-50 dB) -> "Inconclusive (Low Energy)".
  Catches silence, ambient tracks, and long silent intros.
- RMS(highpass@15k) < NO_HF_DB (-72 dB) -> "Inconclusive (Low Energy)".
  No HF content at all to measure (naturally bass-heavy track, or a very
  low-bitrate transcode below our analysis window).
- Lossy codecs -> "N/A (Lossy Codec)".  The file already declares itself lossy.
- DSD -> "Lossless Codec (DSD)".  DSD is treated as out of scope for the
  PCM brickwall detector.
